[activatable]

What the point of being "activatable"?

* to show where is the focus (decorate "active" node with special style)
* to manipulate focus upon activation (restore focus state, possibly to none)
* to manipulate focus upon de-activation (remove focus state from child node, if any)
* register activatable node with somw kind of "window manager" (windows taskbar)

facts:
* Active node is a parent of a focused node.
* If there is an Active node, global focus must be inside or no focus at all.
* Active and Focused states are closely related.
* Active state must never conflict with Focused state.
* Focused state prevails.
* Active and Focused concepts have completely different purposes.
  - "Activness" is logical concept of UI (for convenience and usability)
  - "Focusness" is fundation of input machinery
* Change of Z-order is a "side effect" of Activation, not purpose.

conclusions:
* Activation could happen as result of focus event or programically.
* Focus event may result in Activation either of self or parent node.
* Activatable node must be Focusable node as well.
* Activatable have zero or one "Active Focusable" child node.
* if activated programically ...
* if activated by focus event of focusable child node ...
* if activated by focus event of non-focusable child node ...

implementation:
* "Activate" should be a slot, not a state event handler.
* Activatable interface inherits from Focusable interface (do we need interface at all?)
* Upon receiving focus, a "Activatable" node have to
  1. transfer focus from current focused node to a child node (if any), or self.
  3. emit "Activated" signal (optional)
* To get Active state of an Activatable node ...
  check if a node is on the path from focused node to root.
* node activated by receiving focus event
* node activated by intercepting child focus event

notes:
* Transfer of focus should be atomic operation.

[focus]

* global state
* event manager should have an interface to set focus programically
* node focus handler should sistinguish betwin focus reasons (click, programically)
* click event (by an event manager from system)
  1. event manager generates focus event (and propagate it) for click target
  2. propogate/deliver click event to click target
* programically (by an event manager from an interface)
  1. propogate/deliver focus event propagate it) for click target
