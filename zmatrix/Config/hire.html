<p>In need of a software developer?</p>

<p>When not tinkering around with animated desktop software, I make a living developing software.
&nbsp;My focus in the past has been on computer graphics software, but I try to keep all my options open.</p>

<p>I am university educated, with a degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Alberta in Canada.
&nbsp;I have had years of experience
developing network focused multi-lingual (Unicode based) 2D and 3D graphics software
(predominantly in the Geographic Information Systems field)
for both Windows and Linux allowing me to use both the OpenGL/Mesa and
(to a lesser extent -- for a separate set of tasks) DirectX graphics libraries.
</p>

<p>Besides graphics work, I try to experiment with other aspects of development. &nbsp;From COM objects such as the
embedded browser you are reading this from, or the rendering class responsible for drawing the streaming character
effect at the core of this program, to inter-process communications such as that used between this core program
and the associated screensaver and winamp plugin, and further to multi-threaded programming techniques such as those employed
within this program to allow monitoring of some wallpaper state changes while the main program thread is running,
I always try to keep informed on different aspects of software development.
</p>

If you are in need of a developer with this type of skill set (either on a contract or full-time basis), or just want
additional information, feel free to contact me.  The latest contact information should be kept on the ZMatrix website
(<a href="http://zmatrix.n3.net" target="_blank">http://zmatrix.n3.net</a>), but failing that, you can try my current
(at the time of writing) email address of: <a href="mailto:zmatrix_background@hotmail.com">zmatrix_background@hotmail.com</a>.
